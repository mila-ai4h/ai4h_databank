      "Document:  concepts of accessibility, inclusive design and There are many successful examples of universal design are often intertwined, the inclusive AI; and many more examples goal is always the same – that is the human where inclusively-designed AI challenges right to universal access. While the underlying preconceived notions of violations of privacy principles of universal and inclusive design are and perpetuated prejudice. For example, AI virtually identical, the difference is a matter of can provide people with disabilities greater perspective and source (May, 2018). design seeks to expand the range and diversity of end users recognising that one size doesn’t fit all. This notion is particularly suited to technological advancement. the use of AI in the design of an intelligent cognitive orthosis for people with dementia and Alzheimer’s disease minimises the encroachment of a full-time Fundamental principles in inclusive design care team into the personal life of a person include: recognising diversity and uniqueness inclusive processes and tools broader beneficial impact. It is important to incorporate a diversity of insights and voices in the design process. To achieve this participation, design and development tools must be accessible. Inclusive accommodation throughout the design process will ensure that the entire spectrum of users reap the benefits of the technology, and the inputs, processes, outputs and governance are inclusive and universal. In addition, attention to inclusive design will provide autonomy and dignity for people with disability and those who may otherwise experience exclusion. 4 Inclusive outputs To ensure that AI outputs accommodate a wide variety of users and more users derive benefits, diversity should be recognised in both datasets and AI design. Recent debate with these conditions. While simple text on a webpage, lifts at train stations or an electric toothbrush may have been designed for disability, they benefit us all.\n",

      "Document:  Así, instrumentos como el GEM, Global Entrepreneurship Index (GEI) y otros indicadores internacionales calculados por el Banco de Desarrollo de América Latina, el Foro Económico Mundial, y la OCDE, permiten comparaciones internacionales, pero se basan en información de percepción, lo cual dificulta la interpretación de sus resultados, la identificación de las problemáticas, y en ocasiones tienen restricciones de acceso a los microdatos. Por otra parte, importantes esfuerzos se han realizado para generar caracterizaciones del ecosistema emprendedor, y aunque son extensivas en la información que presentan, no suelen ser continuas ni comparables.

Nota: (a) las fuentes mostradas en la figura son ejemplos de las principales fuentes y estudios sobre emprendimiento con información para Colombia En cuanto a la información de encuestas con representatividad estadística o de los registros administrativos, esta no está diseñada para capturar información de emprendimiento y no incluyen la actividad informal. El Registro Único Empresarial recolectado por las Cámaras de Comercio, incluye solo empresas formales y se enfoca en la creación o supervivencia de las empresas. Por su parte, las operaciones estadísticas que recogen la actividad empresarial fallan en capturar la información de los emprendimientos pues no alcanzan los parámetros necesarios para entrar en el muestreo (Departamento Administrativo Nacional de Estadística [DANE], 2017).\n",

In April 2019, the Jamaican Supreme Court largely agreed with the expressed concerns and handed down a historic ruling, designating the new NIRA law “null, void and of no effect”. 2 Legislative context Jamaica is a parliamentary democracy that gained political independence from Britain some 57 years ago, in 1962. Since then, two major political par- ties, the currently ruling Jamaica Labour Party (JLP) and the opposition People’s National Party (PNP), have alternated power, both claiming strong affinity to democracy and the rule of law. The apex of the judicial system is still the United Kingdom Privy Council, but the country’s Supreme Court, headed by an independent chief justice, serves as the top court of original jurisdiction. The Supreme Court in- cludes a constitutional division. Jamaica’s independence constitution was amended with bi-partisan support in April 2011 to include a Charter of Fundamental Rights and Free- doms, which established or strengthened a range of key citizen protections.

       "      <td>The Government responded to these recommendations in June 2018,5 and the report and response were debated in the House on 19 november 2018.6 Lord McFall of Alcluith, the Senior Deputy Speaker and Chair of the Liaison Committee, wrote to the Minister of State for Universities, Science, Research and Innovation on 30 January 2020 with a number of questions. 7 We received a very full reply on 14 August 2020. . Lord Clement-Jones, who was Chair of the Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence, wrote to Lord McFall on 11 February 2020 making the case for evidence sessions to be held on the AI Committee’s report. At a meeting on 26 February 2020 the Liaison Committee accepted this,9 and evidence sessions were arranged for March. They had to be postponed, but eventually took place on 14 October 2020, when five members of the former Select Committee joined the Liaison Committee to hear evidence from nine witnesses over three sessions. The names of the members are recorded in Appendix 1, and those of the witnesses in Appendix 2. We are most grateful to them all. 7. Since the publication of the Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence’s report in April 2018, investment in, and focus on, the United Kingdom’s approach to artificial intelligence has grown significantly. 10 Artificial intelligence has been deployed in the UK in a range of fields—from agriculture and healthcare, to financial services, through to customer service, retail and logistics. It is being used to help tackle the COVID-19 pandemic,11 but is also being used to underpin facial recognition technology, deep fakes,12 and other ethically challenging uses. The adage from John McCarthy that “as soon as it works no one calls it AI any more”13 continues to ring true: AI has become such a prevalent feature of modern life, that it is not always clear when, and how, it is being used. It is all the more important that we understand its opportunities and risks. Public understanding and data 9.</td>\n",

In April 2019, the Jamaican Supreme Court largely agreed with the expressed concerns and handed down a historic ruling, designating the new NIRA law “null, void and of no effect”. 2 Legislative context Jamaica is a parliamentary democracy that gained political independence from Britain some 57 years ago, in 1962. Since then, two major political par- ties, the currently ruling Jamaica Labour Party (JLP) and the opposition People’s National Party (PNP), have alternated power, both claiming strong affinity to democracy and the rule of law. The apex of the judicial system is still the United Kingdom Privy Council, but the country’s Supreme Court, headed by an independent chief justice, serves as the top court of original jurisdiction. The Supreme Court in- cludes a constitutional division. Jamaica’s independence constitution was amended with bi-partisan support in April 2011 to include a Charter of Fundamental Rights and Free- doms, which established or strengthened a range of key citizen protections. Among other provisions, the Charter specifies that “Parliament shall pass no law and no organ of the state shall take any action which abrogates, abridges or infringes the guar- anteed rights”.   \n",

Certainly, the Government now seems to be aware of the need for coordination between the wide variety of bodies: the national Data Strategy, launched on 9 September 2020, states: “We will consider the roles of the Alan Turing Institute, the national Innovation Centre for Data, the Open Data Institute, the Data Skills Taskforce, the AI Council, the UK Cyber Security Council, the Data Lab, and others in the data skills ecosystem for ways to improve the leadership and facilitation of new and better collaborations between industry, the public sector, universities and institutes. We believe however that more needs to be done. Coordination needs to be raised to a higher and more influential level. This is not a case where one Minister or department needs to be given greater or even sole responsibility. In a matter of such importance there needs to be cooperation at a formal ministerial level. We anticipate that matters relating to AI which are of sufficient importance to be decided by Ministers collectively will currently go to the Domestic and Economy Implementation Committee of the Cabinet, whose remit is “To support collective agreement of matters relating to the implementation and delivery of domestic and economic policy.   \n",

Once a project has been identified, a team is formed according to one of the models below and a tech partner is identified via the public tender process outlined below. This ensures the high quality of deliverables and at the same time, that each project contributes to a building block towards a fully integrated, unified government platform for AI which is scalable, extendable, and robust enough to also accommodate the creation of new applications with speed, ease and cost-effectiveness. It also serves to build capacity within the country, which can then be fed into the industry, as well as to encourage and grow the private sector.

While the GDPR and PIPL appear to have similar cross-border transfer tests, there are material differences. The PIPL does not provide for derogations or mechanisms such as Binding Corporate Rules and standard data protection clauses for companies to gain approval, which are found in the GDPR. Additionally, data localization laws in China may increase compliance costs for companies engaged in data collection from different countries. Therefore, while the PIPL addresses personal information protection, it does not align completely with international data protection standards like the GDPR.  \n",

Additionally, the deal encourages the government to consult on the need to improve access to funding within the UK for SMEs with a substantive AI component looking to scale their business.  \n",

The CDR focuses on the consumer's choice and ability to share their data, rather than a business's right to share consumer data. While the specific application of the CDR to AI applications is not mentioned in the provided documents, it can be inferred that the CDR would apply to personal data used in AI applications. This means that consumers would have the right to control and authorize the use of their personal data in AI applications, ensuring that they can effectively exercise control over their data in this context.  \n",
