"Agencies should calibrate approaches concerning these principles and consider case-specific factors to optimize net benefits. AI is expected to have a positive impact across many sectors of social and economic life, including employment, transportation, education, finance, healthcare, personal security, and manufacturing. At the same time, AI applications could pose risks to privacy, individual rights, personal choice, civil liberties, public health, safety, and security that must be carefully assessed and appropriately addressed. Since the continued adoption and acceptance of AI will depend significantly on public trust and validation, the government's regulatory and non-regulatory approaches to AI should contribute to public trust in AI by promoting reliable, robust, and trustworthy AI applications. The appropriate regulatory or non­ regulatory response to privacy and other risks must necessarily depend on the nature of the risk presented and the tools available to mitigate those risks. confidence. Agencies must provide ample opportunities for the public to provide information and participate in all stages of the rulemaking process, to the extent feasible and consistent with legal requirements (including legal constraints on participation to, for example, protect national security and address imminent threats or respond to emergencies). Agencies are also encouraged, to the extent practicable, to inform the public and promote awareness and widespread availability of voluntary frameworks or standards and the creation of other informative documents. 3.

"Data availability is lagged, so trends and effects of most recent policy measures may only show in the future. Inward investment into advanced economies in AI-related companies grew very significantly in aggregate value and, to a lesser extent, in numbers of transactions between 2015 and 2019 (Arnold, Rahkovsky and Huang, 2020, p. 14[7]) – against the trend of declining FDI flow volumes in that period overall (OECD, 2021[8]). Caseloads under investment screening mechanisms also increased significantly in several countries over past years (Figure 6.2). However, few transactions are known to have been prohibited or unwound in OECD countries in recent years overall, and where such measures were taken, AI as such did not appear to have played a major role. Naturally, these data have to be used with caution: Investors may have withdrawn or not envisaged specific transactions where they sensed potential regulatory obstacles, hence this data may underestimate the effect on policy. However, the fact that transactions with specific other characteristics experienced increased and public scrutiny, it would appear that foreign investment in companies that develop AI or AI-applications suggests that new policies related to AI have been implemented with restraint.

"From this information, ASIC has created a data set of an anonymised map of linked trading accounts. This data set will be ingested into Kx Analyst and will be linked to MAI trading data to create different analytics to improve ASIC’s market surveillance capability of identifying market misconduct. Use cases by agencies involved in combatting corruption: better detecting criminal allegations and fraud Law enforcement agencies become aware of corruption and foreign bribery allegations through many different sources – including through media articles, embassies, international cooperation, self-reporting, financial intelligence units (FIUs), tax authorities, and whistleblowers (OECD, 2017[18]). Some of these sources depend on the processing of large amounts of diverse sets of data to detect suspicious transactions or patterns that could lead to an investigation. Against this backdrop, survey results suggest that the use of AI tools by law enforcement agencies can stand as a catalyst to better identify such transactions and patterns, in turn leading to greater detection rates. In particular, the use of AI tools appears to be most relevant for financial intelligence units (FIUs) to better detect criminal allegations. This is because anti-money laundering regulations generally require multiple reporting obligations from financial institutions and Designated Non-Financial Businesses and Professions (DNFBPs), and FIUs also usually use information from other sources to prepare financial intelligence reports. As such, many countries appear to have already adopted – or are aiming to adopt – AI tools to sort, connect, and prioritise data in suspicious transactions reports.",How can AI tools improve the detection of market misconduct and suspicious trading activities?,2.0

"For example, judgements regarding the occupational-specific credentialing exams might use an approach similar to that used to assess computer capabilities to respond correctly to items on the Survey of Adult Skills (PIAAC) (Elliott, 2017[4]). the capabilities of AI systems to respond correctly items on to Alternative procedures might be used for judging the capabilities of AI with regard to the work-related tasks and activity descriptors or the abilities, skills and knowledge areas in the ONET Content Model. For instance, SMEs could identify the maximum point on each ONET scale to represent the level of activities at which an AI system could be expected to perform, given a specified amount of resources required for development. These judgements would be similar to those collected in standard-setting studies using the Bookmark method (Karantonis and Sireci, 2006[5]). In that case, SMEs are asked to identify the most difficult item on an assessment that a minimally qualified examinee would be likely to answer correctly. These judgements would not be tied to specific occupations. Therefore, they would not necessarily need to be collected for each individual occupation included in the sample. That said, job incumbents from a variety of occupations should be included in the teams. They would provide the judgements for these cross-occupational descriptors. They could also collect judgements regarding these descriptors from different groups of SMEs (each focusing on different occupations) to evaluate the extent to which they generalise across occupations.

"Parallel computers are becoming increasingly important and prevalent. Such computer hardware (such as supercomputers, clusters, GPUs) contain substantial numbers of computing units (think neurons). These can carry out their operations independently of each other, and therefore can operate simultaneously. Many parallel methods (such as search) are typically implemented onto parallel hardware to speed up their operation. Remarkably, most ANN operations, especially the still-prevalent “supervised” systems such as “backpropagation” (and “multi-layer perceptrons”, more generally), are not entirely parallel. Consequently, they still require expensive hardware to run. Interestingly, vast swaths of land around major hydroelectric dam sites are owned by the few major tech firms. Most of these firms specialise in AI, including Google (Alphabet), Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Netflix, Microsoft and IBM. Why this strange connection between computer tech companies and hydroelectric dams? Their “server farms”, i.e. stations of large numbers of computer clusters, run so hot that their power and cooling costs require plentiful power sources. In other words, AI is not cheap or prevalent as yet: much of it still requires extreme resource usage just to run at all (Jones, 2018[1]; Pearce, 2018[2]). How is someone’s intelligence or aptitude assessed for a task? Typically, specific tests designed to identify traits and abilities have been found to correlate with humans who previously performed well in the task or job of interest. Tests of this kind omit enormous sets of actual worker characteristics desired by an employer. This is because the worker is assumed to be human with standard human capabilities. These capabilities are taken for granted, and not explicitly tested. In other words, humans are ostensibly tested for their necessary skills.

These can carry out their operations independently of each other, and therefore can operate simultaneously. Many parallel methods (such as search) are typically implemented onto parallel hardware to speed up their operation. Remarkably, most ANN operations, especially the still-prevalent “supervised” systems such as “backpropagation” (and “multi-layer perceptrons”, more generally), are not entirely parallel. Consequently, they still require expensive hardware to run. Interestingly, vast swaths of land around major hydroelectric dam sites are owned by the few major tech firms. Most of these firms specialise in AI, including Google (Alphabet), Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Netflix, Microsoft and IBM. Why this strange connection between computer tech companies and hydroelectric dams? Their “server farms”, i.e. stations of large numbers of computer clusters, run so hot that their power and cooling costs require plentiful power sources. In other words, AI is not cheap or prevalent as yet: much of it still requires extreme resource usage just to run at all (Jones, 2018[1]; Pearce, 2018[2]). How is someone’s intelligence or aptitude assessed for a task? Typically, specific tests designed to identify traits and abilities have been found to correlate with humans who previously performed well in the task or job of interest. Tests of this kind omit enormous sets of actual worker characteristics desired by an employer. This is because the worker is assumed to be human with standard human capabilities. These capabilities are taken for granted, and not explicitly tested. In other words, humans are ostensibly tested for their necessary skills.

"d) Automated rationalisation of teachers: AI tools can be used to develop automated teacher posting and transfer systems, using analytics based on demand – supply gaps across schools in the State, candidate’s prior postings, candidate preferences, etc. This would help in plugging of gaps in teacher distribution more effectively. e) Customised professional development courses: To tackle issues of poorly designed professional development courses with poor coverage, adaptive AI tools can be used to design automated, customised professional development training content for the teacher based on their performance, identification of their knowledge and skill gaps. This could then be continuously adapted as teacher’s skills and concepts improve. Pearson’s WriteToLearn software uses natural language processing technology to give students personalised feedback, hints, and tips to improve their writing skills.

No. But when I reach that 67th essay, I’m not [really] accurate, either. As a team, [WriteToLearn and I] are pretty good”. Essay grading technology cannot substitute for a teacher’s ability to provide feedback and coaching on particular words and sentences: the software merely rates students’ essays in general areas— such as organisation, idea development, and style—and then provides generic suggestions for improvement in these areas. But when teachers use the software as a first pass at grading and then interject their detailed feedback to address the improvement areas identified by the software, essay grading becomes a much less time-consuming and laborious process.
