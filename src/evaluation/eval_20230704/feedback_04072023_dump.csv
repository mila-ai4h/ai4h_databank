 'In this situation, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), applicable since 2018, has introduced a set of rights that relate to the explainability of AI and, in particular, that provide any individual subject to such a decision the possibility to ask for an explanation. The recognized opaqueness of the latest generation of AI systems raises the issue of how to ensure that EU citizens are able to assert this right in contexts where a decision taken by an AI-powered system has a negative impact on their life. The scientific community took the measure of these concerns at an early stage, and started to provide technical solutions to increase both the robustness and the explainability of AI systems. Despite these efforts, there is still a gap between the resulting scientific outcomes of research and the legitimate expectations the society may have on this novel technology. Even if AI systems currently stay under human supervision in relatively controlled environment, AI is expected to be deployed on a much larger scale in the next years, and this situation calls for an appropriate answer from regulatory bodies. To this end, the European Commission has committed itself to set up the principles of a trustworthy and secure use of AI in the digital society. Built on the multiple initiatives linked to the cybersecurity of digital systems, in particular the Cybersecurity Act, proposed in 2017, that introduced an EU-wide cybersecurity certification framework for digital products, services and processes, an ecosystem around AI technologies is rapidly emerging to favour innovation while protecting fundamental rights. The new Commission which took office in December 2019 is also determined to foster and regulate AI at the EU level, based on the policy activities that have been implemented since 2018.'

 'AI methods are famously known to have limited capacity to provide the reasoning principles behind a decision, mainly due to the fact that the logic is automatically inferred from vast amounts of data, and embedded in complex mathematical structures that are successful but very opaque for humans. The explainability of methods is then becoming crucial in this context to ensure the rights of individuals to understand a decision concerning them. AI systems fall under the scope of the Cybersecurity Act, proposed by the European Commission in 2017, and that introduced an EU-wide cybersecurity certification framework for digital products, services and processes. In the same way cybersecurity techniques have evolved over time to adapt to new devices and new practices, the need to secure and improve reliability of AI systems has become prevalent, as their opaqueness exposes them to strong defects, both intentional and non-intentional. Inside the AI community, connected discussions around AI safety [5], or biases and accountability in AI [6, 7] have emerged, and led to significant advances on this question. Thus, explainability and robustness are largely intertwined: understanding the mechanisms of a system is a standard approach to guarantee its reliability. In light of the serious threats that AI poses to all parts of the European society, from the violation and endangerment of the rights of citizens, to the jeopardizing of activities of European business, to the potential uses by malicious actors, regulating frameworks need to consider the uptake of AI technologies and their complications to mitigate its risks and ensure a trustworthy environment for its development. This report aims to identify some of these limitations, and to provide with potential solutions for policy makers. Its central angle is to make the connection between the legitimate expectations in terms of robustness and explainability and the current scientific landscape of AI on these topics.'

In addition, enabling conditions must be ensured, such as cyber security and an adequate ethical and regulatory framework, as well as building strengths in all sectors and incentives for collaborations between them in order to establish the desired ecosystem. All of these will make it possible to reduce the gap between Israel and the leading global players and gain a relative advantage in the worlds of technology and high-tech in a way that will ensure our spot in the global race, which is critical to Israel’s economy, society, and national security. 20 | The National Initiative for Secured Intelligent Systems – Part I: Executive Summary and Recommendations In formulating the required strategy, we are, formally, somewhat behind most countries of the world. Official strategy papers for artificial intelligence (including the allocation of government budgets) have already been published not only by the major superpowers (such as the United States, Russia and China), or even “medium-sized” countries (such as the United Kingdom, France and others), but also by small countries (such as Finland, Singapore and others).'

The Government plans the Hall-Pesenti Review to adopt recommendation that ‘data trusts’ be established to facilitate the ethical sharing of data between organisations. However, under the current proposals, individuals who have their personal data contained within these trusts would have no means by which they could make their views heard, or shape the decisions of these trusts. We therefore recommend that as data trusts are developed under the guidance of the Centre for Data Ethics and Innovation, provision should be made for the representation of people whose data is stored, whether this be via processes of regular consultation, personal data representatives, or other means. 83.

Although it has not yet enacted laws specific to AI ethics or risks, the Singaporean government passed revisions to the Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA) in 2012. This law governs how most businesses operating in Singapore treat personal information and prohibits data transfers to countries without comparable protections. Like the GDPR and other similar laws, the PDPA could affect AI development and adoption in Singapore—it could help businesses limit the privacy and data protection risks of automated systems but also pose implications for the data transfers and flows that are essential to their creation. In addition, Singapore has released nonbinding guidance to help organizations navigate data ethics and governance principles, such as transparency, fairness, and explainability. It developed the Trusted Data Sharing Framework94 in 2019 to help foster a nascent data sharing ecosystem by guiding companies and nongovernmental organizations through trust and security considerations of data exchanges. 95 The same year, Singapore also released its Model AI Governance Framework, which outlines how AI systems work, how to reduce bias in AI applications, and how to facilitate open and transparent communication. 96 Singapore’s Model AI Governance Framework is framed broadly to apply to a range of technologies, sectors, and business models, providing guidance in areas such as how to identify and address risks associated with AI adoption, such as accuracy and bias. Like the EU Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI, Singapore’s framework also offers suggestions on the levels of human oversight necessary to mitigate any potential risks from adoption.'

 'Infocomm Media Development Authority published the Digital Economy Framework for Action in May 2018. This maps out a framework for action to transform Singapore into a leading digital economy, identifying AI as a frontier technology to drive Singapore’s digital transformation (Singapore, 2018[36]). The Personal Data Protection Commission published a model AI governance framework in January 2019 to promote responsible adoption of AI in Singapore. The model framework provides practical guidance to convert ethical principles into implementable practices. It builds on a discussion paper and national discussions by a Regulators’ Roundtable, a community of practice comprising sector regulators and public agencies. Organisations can adopt the model framework voluntarily. It also serves as a basis to develop sector-specific AI governance frameworks. To develop Singapore into a leading knowledge centre with international expertise in AI policy and regulations, the country set up a five-year Research Programme on the Governance of AI and Data Use in September 2018. It is headquartered at the Centre for AI & Data Governance of the Singapore Management University School of Law. The Centre focuses on industry-relevant research of AI as it relates to industry, society and business. In May 2018, the Swedish government published a report called Artificial Intelligence in Swedish Business and Society. The report, which aims to strengthen AI research and innovation in Sweden, outlines six strategic priorities: i) industrial development, including manufacturing; ii) travel and transportation; iii) sustainable and smart cities; iv) healthcare; v) financial services; and vi) security, including police and customs. The report highlights the need to reach a critical mass in research, education and innovation. It also calls for co-operation regarding investment for research and infrastructure, education, regulatory development and mobility of labour forces (Vinnova, 2018[37]).'

Among these are new technologies capable of rendering more efficient the production process itself – in automated value chain management, for example – and other technologies that disrupt business models and change the distribution of value creation (with the advent of platform models for b2b marketplaces or service POLICY BRIEF . 12.2018 provision, for instance). Ensuring the competitiveness of the Mittelstand by helping it to adopt AI-powered solutions as fast as possible is thus one of the strategy’s main aims. A central objective of the strategy is to turn Germany into a leading hub for “AI made in Germany” and improve the link between research and practitioners – in test centres adjunct to the nodes in the research network, for example. In these centres, companies should have an opportunity to test new technologies in order to generate faster spillover from research to industry. France also wants to support key sectors of its industry in their adoption of AI technologies and the development of “AI ecosystems”. However, the approach is broader and sector-based. Four strategic sectors are explicitly mentioned: health, ecology, mobility/transport, and defence/security. These sectors serve the “general interest” and would according to the strategy therefore require state intervention. However, the choice of sectors also appears to be clearly driven by further industrial policy interests and reflects in part the structure of the French economy. This ecosystem approach is based on bringing together all relevant stakeholders (researchers, companies, public authorities) for the development, adoption and regulatory support of new technologies.'

The United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority established the world\u2019s first regulatory sandbox in 2015. The sandbox seeks to provide financial firms with a) the ability to test products and services in a controlled environment; b) reduced time-to-market at potentially lower costs; c) support in identifying appropriate consumer protection safeguards to build into new products and services; and d) better access to finance (FCA, 2021[57]). This model has been replicated in more than 50 countries (BIS, 2020[58]). In 2020, the FCA partnered with The Alan Turing Institute to better understand the practical challenges of AI transparency and explainability in the financial sector. The European Commission is considering the development of large-scale AI testing and experimentation facilities, which will be available to all actors across Europe to help avoid duplication of efforts. These testing facilities may include regulatory sandboxes in selected areas (European Commission, 2020[59]).

 'Some international organisations plan to translate high-level AI principles into legal frameworks while they are considering risk-based approaches. Some countries are developing technical standards to support the implementation of trustworthy AI. The use of AI systems whose recommendations are acted upon automatically without human involvement in the public sector has come under increased scrutiny. To ensure the development and deployment of trustworthy AI, governments are exploring a variety of regulatory approaches that include: amending existing laws; introducing requirements for the mandatory bias testing of AI systems; prohibiting or banning the use of AI systems in specific contexts, or establishing public registries to ensure that AI systems are efficient and accurate. They are also establishing ethical oversight bodies to advise regulators and ensure that AI systems are used in trustworthy ways. Most countries have introduced guidelines for trustworthy AI that are largely in line with the OECD AI Principles. Examples include Australia’s AI Ethics Framework, Colombia’s Ethics Framework for Artificial Intelligence, Germany’s Data Ethics Commission ethics recommendations; Hungary’s AI Ethical Guidelines, Japan’s AI R&D Guidelines and AI Utilisation Guidelines, Singapore’s Model AI Governance Framework, and the European Commission’s Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI.'

Indeed, the OECD AI Principles adopted in 2019 are the first intergovernmental standards on AI. Like governments elsewhere, those in the Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) region are seeking to tap into the immense potential of AI in a strategic and trustworthy manner. Seven LAC countries have developed, or are developing, a national AI strategy (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Peru and Uruguay), and seven have adhered to the OECD AI Principles (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Mexico and Peru). The importance of adopting AI in the public sector is recognised in the majority of national AI strategies. In fact, governments are increasingly using AI for public sector innovation and transformation, redefining how they design and deliver policies and services. This report, conducted by the OECD in collaboration with CAF, Development Bank of Latin America, reviews the strategic and responsible use of AI by the public sector in the LAC region. In the LAC region, all seven countries with a national AI strategy either have a strategy in place for AI in the public sector, or a dedicated focus within their broader strategy. These strategies tend to focus on key themes, including ethics, AI governance, AI adoption, cross-sector collaboration and procurement, skills and capacities, data and technical infrastructure.

The group of countries examined is referred to here as the LAC12. The main findings of the report are as follows: Most of the LAC12 have established solid foundations from a government perspective, since they are developing their AI systems in alignment with government efforts directed at increasing connectivity, infrastructure development, national digitalization strategies, open data, and national AI agendas. All of the countries studied have a digital strategy and, with the exception of Trinidad and Tobago, also have an open data agenda. Uruguay and Colombia have already formulated their national AI strategies, while Brazil and Chile are in the process of doing so. Mexico and Argentina have embarked on a signifi- cant effort by including the ecosystem in the development of a national strategy proposal that still needs to be consolidated.

","The most common AI policies include:

1. National AI Strategies: Many countries are developing and implementing national AI strategies to guide their approach to AI development and adoption. These strategies often focus on areas such as financing AI research and development, addressing societal challenges, promoting AI uptake by businesses, fostering inclusive social dialogue, and equipping the population with AI skills.

2. Inclusive Growth and Well-being: AI policies often prioritize inclusive growth, sustainable development, and well-being. This means that AI should contribute to economic growth while also considering social and environmental impacts.

3. Human-Centered Values and Fairness: AI policies emphasize the importance of human-centered values and fairness. This includes ensuring that AI systems are designed and used ethically, respecting human rights, and addressing issues of fairness, justice, and privacy.

4. Infrastructure and Data Access: Policies around infrastructure and data access are crucial for AI development. This includes investments in AI compute capacity, such as data centers or data science workstations, to support AI innovation. It also involves ensuring access to relevant and high-quality data for training AI systems.

5. AI Ecosystem and Human Capacity: Policies aim to foster a thriving AI ecosystem by supporting research institutions, startups, and businesses working in the field of AI. Additionally, policies focus on equipping the population with the necessary skills to develop and use AI, as well as ensuring a fair labor market transition for workers.

 'Investing in AI research can bring greater understanding of the challenges and is one potential source of new solutions. Similarly, investing in development of technical standards can provide critical input to policy makers by allowing more accurate and informative measurement of AI systems and their attributes. Overall, the policy intelligence gathered in this exercise suggest that a mix of policies are needed when building trustworthy and human-centric AI – the goal of advancing the G20 AI Principles. As the G20 considers further actions toward advancing the G20 AI Principles, it will be valuable to reflect on policies around infrastructure, data access, the AI ecosystem, and human capacity.

","Transparency is a prevalent principle in AI policies. It is often mentioned as a way to minimize harm, improve AI, foster trust, and ensure accountability. The policies emphasize the need for transparency in various aspects of AI systems, including data processing methods, decision-making processes, and the workings of AI systems. Transparency measures may include making data used to train AI systems transparent, ensuring the methods are accessible and understandable, authorizing external audits, and disclosing when AI is being used in predictions, recommendations, or decisions. Workers are also often granted the right to demand transparency in AI systems' decisions and outcomes. However, there is significant variation in the interpretation, justification, domain of application, and mode of achievement of transparency in different policy documents.","{""1"":{""source"":""Orsolya"",""country"":""OECD"",""title"":""OECD\/Artificial Intelligence in Society\/9\/84"",""content"":""It would further bias the algorithm \u2013 and society \u2013 against these neighbourhoods (O\u2019Neil, 2016[25]). The technical and the policy meanings of the term \u201ctransparency\u201d differ. For policy makers, transparency traditionally focuses on how a decision is made, who participates in the process and the factors used to make the decision (Kosack and Fung, 2014[26]). From this perspective, transparency measures might disclose how AI is being used in a prediction, recommendation or decision. They might also disclose when a user is interacting with an AI-powered agent. For technologists, transparency of an AI system focuses largely on process issues. It means allowing people to understand how an AI system is developed, trained and deployed. It may also include insight into factors that impact a specific prediction or decision. It does not usually include sharing specific code or datasets. In many cases, the systems are too complex for these elements to provide meaningful transparency (Wachter, Mittelstadt and Russell, 2017[27]). Moreover, sharing specific code or datasets could reveal trade secrets or disclose sensitive user data. More generally, awareness and understanding of AI reasoning processes is viewed as important for AI to become commonly accepted and useful. Table 4.1. Approaches to improve the transparency and accountability of AI systems In some situations, it is possible to give theoretical guarantees about an AI system backed by proof. Empirical evidence measures a system\u2019s overall performance, demonstrating the value or harm of the system, without explaining specific decisions. Humans can interpret information about the logic by which a system took a particular set of inputs and reached a particular conclusion. The environment is fully observable (e.g. the game of Go) and both the problem and solution can be formalised. Outcomes can be fully formalised; it is acceptable to wait to see negative outcomes to measure them; issues may only be visible in aggregate."",""url"":""https:\/\/www.oecd-ilibrary.org\/deliver\/eedfee77-en.pdf?itemId=%2Fcontent%2Fpublication%2Feedfee77-en&mimeType=pdf"",""year"":2021,""n_tokens"":385,""source_id"":""64642dad6c6c78bfcefef932"",""similarity"":0.880133867,""similarity_to_answer"":0.9357435391},""0"":{""source"":""Laura v2"",""country"":""United Nations"",""title"":""UN\/UN Resource Guide on AI Strategies_April 2021_rev_0\/95\/105"",""content"":""Principled Artificial Intelligence: Mapping Consensus in Ethical and Rights- based Approaches to Principles for AI (Berkman Klein Center 2020) COMEST 2019 G20 AI Principles 2019 = OECD AI Principles 2019 Berkman Klein Center 2020 WEF Principles Development Tool Transparency Openness The data used to train AI systems should be transparent.

They might also disclose when a user is interacting with an AI-powered agent. For technologists, transparency of an AI system focuses largely on process issues. It means allowing people to understand how an AI system is developed, trained and deployed. It may also include insight into factors that impact a specific prediction or decision. It does not usually include sharing specific code or datasets. In many cases, the systems are too complex for these elements to provide meaningful transparency (Wachter, Mittelstadt and Russell, 2017[27]). Moreover, sharing specific code or datasets could reveal trade secrets or disclose sensitive user data. More generally, awareness and understanding of AI reasoning processes is viewed as important for AI to become commonly accepted and useful. Table 4.1. Approaches to improve the transparency and accountability of AI systems In some situations, it is possible to give theoretical guarantees about an AI system backed by proof. Empirical evidence measures a system’s overall performance, demonstrating the value or harm of the system, without explaining specific decisions. Humans can interpret information about the logic by which a system took a particular set of inputs and reached a particular conclusion. The environment is fully observable (e.g. the game of Go) and both the problem and solution can be formalised. Outcomes can be fully formalised; it is acceptable to wait to see negative outcomes to measure them; issues may only be visible in aggregate.'

AI systems must be transparent Transparency Awareness and literacy AIS technology misuse and awareness of it Workers should have the right to demand transparency in the decisions and outcomes of AI systems, as well as their underlying algorithms. They must also be consulted on AI systems implementation, development and deployment. Featured in 73 of our 84 sources, transparency is the most prevalent principle in the current literature. Thematic analysis reveals significant variation in relation to the interpretation, justification, domain of application and mode of achievement. References to transparency comprise efforts to increase explainability, interpretability or other acts of communication and of application include data use, human–AI interaction, automated decisions and the purpose of data use or application of AI systems. Primarily, transparency is presented as a way to minimize harm and improve AI, though some sources underline its benefit for legal reasons or to foster trust.

 'In 2020, Turkey’s Presidency of Digital Transformation Office28 intends to publish a National AI Strategy, seeking to foster interoperability between those actors holding a crucial position on technology development, notably government, academia, industry and NGOs. The strategy aims to implement data- driven active decision-making processes in governance, supporting the effective use of big data and AI applications by society, defining a framework for data access and sharing, introducing new regulations for ethics and law on AI, and proposing new action plans to advance qualified human resources. The document also has the intention to address fundamental principles such as human-centered development, fairness, transparency, trustworthiness, accountability, and commitment to ethical values.ch/bakom/en/homepage/digital-switzerland-and-internet/strategie-digitale-schweiz. Transparency and explainability AI Actors should commit to transparency and responsible disclosure regarding AI systems. To this end, they should provide meaningful information, appropriate to the context, and consistent with the state of art: i. to foster a general understanding of AI systems; ii. to make stakeholders aware of their interactions with AI systems, including in the workplace; iii. to enable those affected by an AI system to understand the outcome; and iv. to enable those adversely affected by an AI system to challenge its outcome based on plain and easy-to-understand information on the factors, and the logic that served as the basis for the prediction, recommendation or decision Explanation and rationale: The term transparency carries multiple meanings. In the context of this principle, the focus is first on disclosing when AI is being used (in a prediction, recommendation or decision, or that the user is interacting directly with an AI-powered agent, such as a chatbot). Disclosure should be made with proportion to the importance of the interaction.'

Since 2015, governments increasingly include AI strategies in their national policies. This is particularly the case in OECD countries and key partners. Regulation on AI appears to remain minimal, with a clear concern from governments that they do not limit innovation with regulation that may place their country at a global disadvantage. More recently, the OECD Directorate for Science, Technology and Innovation developed a report on the state of implementation of the policy recommendations to governments contained in the OECD AI Principles (OECD, 2021[39]). This report presents a conceptual framework, provides findings, identifies good practices, and examines emerging trends in AI policy, particularly on how countries are implementing the five recommendations to policy makers contained in the OECD AI Principles. Governments are increasingly developing strategies to advance their own efforts to create a conducive environment to innovation and digital transformation. Strategies commonly focus on the future of work, research, and incentivising innovation and leadership. Economic opportunities are driving state AI policies and research investments. Several states designate how AI will help specific sectors of their economies, often including agriculture, industry, healthcare and smart cities. Most national strategies or policies on AI address, in some form, the actual or potential impacts that artificial intelligence may have on people, planet and society. The OECD started work on AI in 2016. The AI principles focus on responsible stewardship of trustworthy AI, and include respect for human rights, fairness, transparency and explainability, robustness and safety, and accountability.

 'The paper found that governments are largely focused on developing AI strategies rather than regulation. Since 2015, governments increasingly include AI strategies in their national policies. This is particularly the case in OECD countries and key partners. Regulation on AI appears to remain minimal, with a clear concern from governments that they do not limit innovation with regulation that may place their country at a global disadvantage. More recently, the OECD Directorate for Science, Technology and Innovation developed a report on the state of implementation of the policy recommendations to governments contained in the OECD AI Principles (OECD, 2021[39]). This report presents a conceptual framework, provides findings, identifies good practices, and examines emerging trends in AI policy, particularly on how countries are implementing the five recommendations to policy makers contained in the OECD AI Principles. Governments are increasingly developing strategies to advance their own efforts to create a conducive environment to innovation and digital transformation. Strategies commonly focus on the future of work, research, and incentivising innovation and leadership. Economic opportunities are driving state AI policies and research investments. Several states designate how AI will help specific sectors of their economies, often including agriculture, industry, healthcare and smart cities. Most national strategies or policies on AI address, in some form, the actual or potential impacts that artificial intelligence may have on people, planet and society. The OECD started work on AI in 2016. The AI principles focus on responsible stewardship of trustworthy AI, and include respect for human rights, fairness, transparency and explainability, robustness and safety, and accountability. There could be a role for the Guidelines also with respect to the implementation of the Recommendation. In early 2020, the OECD launched OECD.'

","The main policies to foster AI skills in EU countries include:

1. Upskilling and reskilling programs: Efforts are being made to upgrade IT skills and data literacy in traditional jobs and sectors. This includes providing training and education programs to help individuals acquire the necessary AI expertise.

2. European initiatives: The European Commission has implemented various initiatives to address the shortage of AI skills. These include the ""New Skills Agenda"" and the Digital Skills and Job Coalition, which aim to upskill and retrain individuals, particularly targeting the young, the unemployed, and SMEs.

3. Talent mobilization: The European Commission is considering a Talent Plan for Artificial Intelligence to mobilize AI talent, ideas, technologies, investments, and businesses across Europe and beyond.

4. Lifelong learning programs: Some countries, such as Finland, have proposed lifelong learning programs that include skills accounts or voucher-based systems to create demand for education and training in AI.

These policies aim to address the shortage of AI skills, promote digital literacy, and foster the creation of AI expertise in order to support the development and adoption of AI technologies in EU countries.","{""1"":{""source"":""Laura v2"",""country"":""European Union"",""title"":""EU\/EU EPSC Strategic Note on AI\/40\/19"",""content"":""61 Despite the evident demand for technology skills, a significant proportion of the EU population \u2013 37% of the European labour force62 \u2013 still does not even have basic digital skills.

 'Governance structures for enabling all the above mandates vary across countries. Many countries have instituted dedicated public offices such as Ministry of AI (UAE), and Office of AI and AI Council (U.K.) while China and Japan have allowed existing ministries to take up AI implementation in their sectoral areas. Not just national governments, but even local city governments have become increasingly aware about the importance and potential of AI and have committed public investments. National governments have significantly increased public funding for AI through commitments such as increasing the R&D spend, setting up industrial and investment funds in AI startups, investing in network and infrastructure and AI-related public procurements. China, USA, France and Japan have committed significant public spending for AI technology development and adoption. Discussion Paper National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence forming “national teams” with large private players to undertake fundamental and applied research are some of the public-private partnership approaches various national governments have espoused. AI technology development and applications are evolving rapidly with major implications for economies and societies. A study by EY and NASCCOM found that by 2022, around 46% of the workforce will be engaged in entirely new jobs that do not exist today, or will be deployed in jobs that have radically changed skillsets5. If some countries decide to wait for a few years to establish an AI strategy and put in place the foundations for developing the AI ecosystem, it seems unlikely that they would be able to attain and match up to the current momentum in the rapidly changing socio-economic environment. Therefore, the need of the hour is to develop a policy framework that will help set up a vibrant AI ecosystem in India. A detailed study of various country strategies for AI is placed in the Appendix II: Global Country Strategy Review.'

This strategy is part of the European Coordinated Plan for Artificial Intelligence and can be understood as a contribution to a synergic action between the countries of the European Union, with the hope that Europe will soon be able to compete with the United States and China. The connection with the international forums for discussion and negotiation represents a foundation of the Italian strategy, largely inspired by the comparison in the EU and OECD (OECD, 2019: Artificial Intelligence in Society) , as well as by the cooperation within the G7 and the G20, and by the contribution of some Italian experts to European tables such as the “High-Level Expert Group on Artificial Intelligence” 13, the “AI Alliance” 14, and to the main laboratories on IA belonging to the research network of the CLAIRE confederation”. Japan: Artificial Intelligence Technology Strategy 61 The Artificial Intelligence Technology Strategy was published by The Strategic Council for AI Technology in March 2017, which was founded in April 2016 to promote Artificial Intelligence in Japan. The goals and measures contained therein support the vision of a super-smart “Society 5.0”, as pursued by Prime Minister Shinzō Abe for several years with a package of policies (“Abenomics”). This strategy divides the process of AI industrialization into three phases. Phase 1: Utilization and application of data-driven AI developed in various domains. Phase 2: Public use of AI and data developed across various domains.'

One proposed instrument in the German strategy to increase the attractiveness of Germany as an AI research hub for national and international talent is the development of programmes that link industry and academia; for example, by supporting dual career programmes for researcher-entrepreneurs. Access to data is identified as another key objective in making Germany a more attractive location for the development and implementation of new AI technologies. The French strategy has similar objectives and planned instruments. To increase the attractiveness of the French research network, it calls for a European cloud infrastructure, European supercomputers, and measures such as the increasing of researcher salaries. 4. Skills and Education Another important aspect mentioned in both strategies is the question of skills and reskilling of the labour force in the face of the rapid technological changes and the loss of job and stable income security that is likely to accompany their widespread implementation.

Almost half of the world\u2019s population are women but they represent a mere 33% of those within the digital sector On a broader level, faced with the scalability of technology and functions linked to AI, our society is bound by a duty of reflexivity and collective vigilance. This is particularly relevant in terms of vulnerable groups in society and those who are already excluded from the digital world, to whom AI may represent even greater risks. In the same vein that AI developments may promise a better society; one that is fairer and more effective, they could also cause the hyper- concentration of profit value for a small, digital elite. Educating larger numbers of people on the principles of AI and algorithms as a precondition for an inclusive policy is vital. The introduction of a subject dedicated to digital humanities, recently announced by the Minister for National Education, could provide assistance in this regard. An inclusive policy for AI must therefore incorporate a dual objective. First, to ensure that the development of AI technology does not cause an increase in social and economic inequality.

Second, it will strengthen enabling conditions, including skills, data policy, trust and resilience, fundamental rights and ethics (e.g. the influence of algorithms on autonomy and equal treatment) and AI-focused research and innovation. In October 2018, “AI for the Netherlands” (AINED), a Dutch coalition of industry and academia, published goals and actions for a national AI plan. These include focusing on promoting access to AI talent and skills, as well as high-value public data. They also aim to facilitate AI-driven business development and promote large-scale use of AI in government. In addition, they envision creating socio- economic and ethical frameworks for AI, encouraging public-private co-operation in key sectors and value chains, and establishing the Netherlands as a world-class AI research centre. The Dutch government plans to finalise a whole-of-government strategic action plan for AI before mid-2019. It was to consider the AINED report, the EU co-ordinated plan and discussions of the European Commission (EC) High-Level Expert Group on AI (AI HLEG). Norway has taken AI initiatives as part of the Digital Agenda for Norway and Long-term Plan for Research and Higher Education that include: Creation of several AI labs, such as the Norwegian Open AI-lab at the Norwegian University for Science and Technology. The Open AI-lab is sponsored by several companies. It focuses on energy, maritime, aquaculture, telecom, digital banking, health and biomedicine, where Norway has a strong international position. A skills-reform programme called Learning for Life with a proposed 2019 budget of NOK 130 million (USD 16 million) to help the workforce develop or upgrade skills in AI, healthcare and other areas. An open data strategy by which government agencies must make their data available in machine-readable formats using application program interfaces and register the available datasets in a common catalogue.'

In the recent EC ICT-48 call, Dutch participants secured €5.9 million of the €50 million in available funding. Safeguarding public values and human rights The opportunities and risks presented by AI and algorithms are a topic of discussion within society, in the media and in political circles.

 'These opportunities must be of benefit to everyone, and first and foremost to women. Indeed, almost half of the world’s population are women but they represent a mere 33% of those within the digital sector (and only 12% if we dismiss cross-sectional and assistant roles). In order to face the challenges posed by AI, it is important to call on the plurality of expertise. Collective action must be as inclusive as possible. Almost half of the world’s population are women but they represent a mere 33% of those within the digital sector On a broader level, faced with the scalability of technology and functions linked to AI, our society is bound by a duty of reflexivity and collective vigilance. This is particularly relevant in terms of vulnerable groups in society and those who are already excluded from the digital world, to whom AI may represent even greater risks. In the same vein that AI developments may promise a better society; one that is fairer and more effective, they could also cause the hyper- concentration of profit value for a small, digital elite. Educating larger numbers of people on the principles of AI and algorithms as a precondition for an inclusive policy is vital. The introduction of a subject dedicated to digital humanities, recently announced by the Minister for National Education, could provide assistance in this regard. An inclusive policy for AI must therefore incorporate a dual objective. First, to ensure that the development of AI technology does not cause an increase in social and economic inequality. Second to call on AI in order to reduce this. Rather than jeopardizing our individual trajectories and solidarity systems, AI must first and foremost help us to promote our fundamental rights, improve social cohesion, and strengthen solidarity.

Consequently, we want to achieve that in Serbia: 1. the education system, among others, develops the competencies for future needs of the job market, referring to professions directly connected with artificial intelligence and all other professions changing under the influence of artificial intelligence, which become more or less necessary or which didn’t even exist earlier; 2. the business sector successfully adapts to new working models and new market expectations accompanied by a strong development of business entities whose business is based on the use of artificial intelligence; 3. the development of scientific research activities significantly contributes to the emergence of highly competent experts in the field of artificial intelligence and its implementations, while research results contribute to the development of the business sector; 4.'

 'The strategy is led by the non-profit Canadian Institute for Advanced Research and backed with government funding of CAD 125 million (USD 100 million). Over five years, the funds will support programmes to expand Canada’s human capital, support AI research in Canada and translate AI research into public- and private-sector applications. The goals of the Pan-Canadian AI Strategy are: 1. Increase AI researchers and skilled graduates in Canada. 2. Establish interconnected nodes of scientific excellence in Canada’s three major AI institutes: in Edmonton (Alberta Machine Intelligence Institute), Montreal (Montreal Institute for Learning Algorithms) and Toronto (Vector Institute for Artificial Intelligence). 3. Develop a global programme on AI in Society and global thought leadership on the economic, social, ethical, policy and legal implications of advances in AI. 4. Support a national research community on AI. The federal government through the National Research Council Canada (NRC) plans research investments totalling CAD 50 million (USD 40 million) over a seven-year period to apply AI to key programme themes including: data analytics, AI for Design, cyber security, Canadian indigenous languages, support for federal superclusters and collaboration centres with Canadian universities, as well as strategic partnerships with international partners. In addition to this federal funding, the Quebec government is allocating CAD 100 million (USD 80 million) to the AI community in Montreal; Ontario is providing CAD 50 million (USD 40 million) to the Vector Institute for Artificial Intelligence. In 2016, the Canada First Research Excellence Fund allocated CAD 93.6 million (USD 75 million) to three universities for cutting-edge research in deep learning: the Université de Montréal, Polytechnique Montréal and HEC Montréal.

The use cases discussed in the previous chapter also show that public data and AI developments have encountered ethical challenges that could be mitigated or clarified if ethical guidance, standards and/or frameworks were in place to help actualise high-level principles. The following sections review the main instruments and initiatives that contribute to developing responsible, trustworthy and human-centric approaches to AI in the public sector. Figure 4.3.'

 'Three LAC countries – Argentina, Brazil and Mexico – have committed to these principles by virtue of their participation in the G20. Some countries have also designed their own country-specific principles. Adhering to or otherwise articulating clear principles for AI represents a positive step for international co-operation, and for bringing about an environment and culture aligned with the societal goals and values articulated in the Principles. Table 4.1 provides an overview of LAC government adherence to the OECD and G20 AI Principles and indicates where own country-specific principles have been put in place. The OECD Principles on Artificial Intelligence support AI that is innovative and trustworthy, and which respects human rights and democratic values. OECD member countries adopted the Principles on 22 May 2019 as part of the OECD Council Recommendation on Artificial Intelligence (OECD, 2019[5]). The Principles set standards for AI that are sufficiently practical and flexible to stand the test of time in a rapidly evolving field. They complement existing OECD standards in areas such as privacy, digital security risk management and responsible business conduct. The Recommendation identifies five complementary, values-based principles for the responsible stewardship of trustworthy AI: AI should benefit people and the planet by driving inclusive growth, sustainable development and well-being. AI systems should be designed in a way that respects the rule of law, human rights, democratic values and diversity, and they should include appropriate safeguards – for example, enabling human intervention where necessary – to ensure a fair and just society. There should be transparency and responsible disclosure around AI systems to ensure that people understand AI-based outcomes and can challenge them. AI systems must function in a robust, secure and safe way throughout their life cycles and potential risks should be continually assessed and managed.'

The report provides good practices and implementation of the five recommendations to policy makers contained in the OECD AI Principles. lessons Countries are at different stages of the development and implementation of national AI strategies and policies. Some countries, such as Canada and Finland, developed their national AI strategies as early as 2017, closely followed by Japan, France, Germany and the United Kingdom in 2018. Other countries, such as Brazil, Egypt, Hungary, Poland and Spain, launched a national AI strategy more recently. Several countries are currently in AI policy consultation and development processes.'

","The key pillars of France's national AI strategy are:

1. Building and structuring a strong French AI system: This pillar focuses on developing a robust AI ecosystem in France by investing in public research and education, creating research hubs linked to industry, and attracting elite AI researchers.

2. Making AI accessible to all companies: This pillar aims to ensure that AI technology is accessible to all companies, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). It includes providing public funding through AI challenges, which allow AI providers and users to propose solutions to concrete problems in key sectors such as health, transportation/mobility, environment, and defense/security.

3. Developing a data-driven French and European economy: This pillar emphasizes the importance of data in driving AI innovation and economic growth. It proposes the creation of ""data commons"" to facilitate data sharing between private and public actors, adapting copyright law to facilitate data mining, and opening up public sector data to industry partners.

Overall, the strategy aims to promote inclusive growth, sustainable development, and well-being, while also addressing transparency and explainability in AI systems.","{""0"":{""source"":""Laura v2"",""country"":""OECD"",""title"":""OECD\/OECD G20 examples-of-ai-national-policies\/81\/10"",""content"":""France \u2013 French AI Strategy: Economic Action Plan Building from the French AI Strategy announced a year earlier, the Economic Action Plan brings a focus to funding, talent and access to data to help develop a data-driven French and European economy.

Indeed, the OECD AI Principles adopted in 2019 are the first intergovernmental standards on AI. Like governments elsewhere, those in the Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) region are seeking to tap into the immense potential of AI in a strategic and trustworthy manner. Seven LAC countries have developed, or are developing, a national AI strategy (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Peru and Uruguay), and seven have adhered to the OECD AI Principles (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Mexico and Peru). The importance of adopting AI in the public sector is recognised in the majority of national AI strategies. In fact, governments are increasingly using AI for public sector innovation and transformation, redefining how they design and deliver policies and services. This report, conducted by the OECD in collaboration with CAF, Development Bank of Latin America, reviews the strategic and responsible use of AI by the public sector in the LAC region. In the LAC region, all seven countries with a national AI strategy either have a strategy in place for AI in the public sector, or a dedicated focus within their broader strategy. These strategies tend to focus on key themes, including ethics, AI governance, AI adoption, cross-sector collaboration and procurement, skills and capacities, data and technical infrastructure.

The following central themes on AI ethics and inclusive policies were considered: Inclusive growth, sustainable development and well-being; human-centered values and fairness; transparency and explainability; robustness, security and safety; and accountability. 18 While this section presents a summary of the findings of this report, it should be pointed out that the pur- pose is not to generalize these findings in terms of the rest of the region, since the 12 countries analyzed are among the most advanced in LAC when it comes to laying the groundwork for AI adoption as a tool for social good. The group of countries examined is referred to here as the LAC12. The main findings of the report are as follows: Most of the LAC12 have established solid foundations from a government perspective, since they are developing their AI systems in alignment with government efforts directed at increasing connectivity, infrastructure development, national digitalization strategies, open data, and national AI agendas. All of the countries studied have a digital strategy and, with the exception of Trinidad and Tobago, also have an open data agenda. Uruguay and Colombia have already formulated their national AI strategies, while Brazil and Chile are in the process of doing so.

A complete list of experts, who were selected on the basis of a mapping of the region and from recommendations, can be found at the beginning of this document under Acknowledgements. For each country, the information collected is organized under the following subsections: a summary of the country’s profile as a general context; documentation of the different efforts by government, academia, and the entrepreneurial sector and civil society to strengthen and develop an AI ecosystem in service of public good to fulfill the SDGs in the region;5 and a general conclusion. A detailed descrip- tion of each subsection and the relevance of each player studied is provided in Annex B. A list of use cases broken down by country, theme, and implementers can be found in Annex C. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE FOR SOCIAL GOOD IN LATIN AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN AI Ethics As per the warning in the report entitled Automate with Caution: Data and Artificial Intelligence in Latin America, the opportunities that AI offers LAC also entail potential risks that have still not fully material- ized given its current state of development (Scrollini 2018). The topic of AI ethics is relatively new in the world and incipient in the region.'

 'Recognising that issues relevant to AI transcend borders, countries are also increasingly adopting regional approaches to AI, including co-ordinated efforts in the European Union (EU) and the African Union, among Nordic-Baltic states and Arab nations, and within the G7 and the G20. The OECD has also strengthened its AI-related efforts in recent years, spearheaded by the OECD. AI Policy Observatory. Indeed, the OECD AI Principles adopted in 2019 are the first intergovernmental standards on AI. Like governments elsewhere, those in the Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) region are seeking to tap into the immense potential of AI in a strategic and trustworthy manner. Seven LAC countries have developed, or are developing, a national AI strategy (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Peru and Uruguay), and seven have adhered to the OECD AI Principles (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Mexico and Peru). The importance of adopting AI in the public sector is recognised in the majority of national AI strategies. In fact, governments are increasingly using AI for public sector innovation and transformation, redefining how they design and deliver policies and services. This report, conducted by the OECD in collaboration with CAF, Development Bank of Latin America, reviews the strategic and responsible use of AI by the public sector in the LAC region. In the LAC region, all seven countries with a national AI strategy either have a strategy in place for AI in the public sector, or a dedicated focus within their broader strategy. These strategies tend to focus on key themes, including ethics, AI governance, AI adoption, cross-sector collaboration and procurement, skills and capacities, data and technical infrastructure. These represent a significant step forward but vary in terms of action items and enablers to help drive progress.'

 '6 The survey results are presented in Figure 6. The following central themes on AI ethics and inclusive policies were considered: Inclusive growth, sustainable development and well-being; human-centered values and fairness; transparency and explainability; robustness, security and safety; and accountability. 18 While this section presents a summary of the findings of this report, it should be pointed out that the pur- pose is not to generalize these findings in terms of the rest of the region, since the 12 countries analyzed are among the most advanced in LAC when it comes to laying the groundwork for AI adoption as a tool for social good. The group of countries examined is referred to here as the LAC12. The main findings of the report are as follows: Most of the LAC12 have established solid foundations from a government perspective, since they are developing their AI systems in alignment with government efforts directed at increasing connectivity, infrastructure development, national digitalization strategies, open data, and national AI agendas. All of the countries studied have a digital strategy and, with the exception of Trinidad and Tobago, also have an open data agenda. Uruguay and Colombia have already formulated their national AI strategies, while Brazil and Chile are in the process of doing so. Mexico and Argentina have embarked on a signifi- cant effort by including the ecosystem in the development of a national strategy proposal that still needs to be consolidated. The lack of digital infrastructure in the region is a key challenge when it comes to the democratization of AI benefits.

The design of most national AI strategies underwent open public consultations and involved numerous stakeholders, including key industry consortia, academia, trade unions and civil society (OECD, 2020[1]). These efforts clearly demonstrate that many countries see AI as a national priority, and are willing to work openly with a broad array of stakeholders to build legitimacy and trust. Among LAC countries, seven have developed, or are in the process of developing, a national AI strategy: Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Peru and Uruguay (see Figure 2.2). 11 This trend signals a growing focus among LAC countries on ensuring they remain competitive with regional and global peers, and a determination to keep up with this rapidly evolving technology and its potential benefits and risks. When LAC strategies are viewed collectively a number of key themes and objectives emerge. For instance, strategies often seek to catalyse economic development through R&D funding and incentives, transform the labour market and strengthen talent pipelines through upskilling programmes, and promote solid data governance and sharing, including through open government data practices. Notably, all strategies include provisions to help ensure that AI systems are designed and implemented in an ethical and trustworthy manner (e.g. the creation of ethical frameworks and governance bodies). A number of strategies also include a focus on international collaboration, notably the strategies of Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Peru.

","The most common AI policies include:

1. National AI Strategies: Many countries are developing and implementing national AI strategies to guide their approach to AI development and adoption. These strategies often focus on areas such as financing AI research and development, addressing societal challenges, promoting AI uptake by businesses, fostering inclusive social dialogue, and equipping the population with AI skills.

2. Inclusive Growth and Well-being: AI policies often prioritize inclusive growth, sustainable development, and well-being. This involves ensuring that AI benefits are widely shared and that AI systems are designed to prioritize human, social, and environmental well-being.

3. Human-Centered Values and Fairness: AI policies emphasize the importance of human-centered values and fairness. This includes addressing issues such as bias, discrimination, and privacy concerns in AI systems. Policies may include regulations and ethical guidelines to ensure the responsible and ethical use of AI.

4. Infrastructure and Data Access: Policies around AI infrastructure and data access are crucial. This involves investing in AI compute capacity, such as data centers or data science workstations, to support AI innovation. It also includes promoting data sharing and access to enable AI development and research.

5. AI Ecosystem and Human Capacity: Policies aim to foster a thriving AI ecosystem and develop the necessary human capacity. This includes supporting AI startups, promoting collaboration between academia and industry, and equipping the workforce with the skills needed for AI development and use.

 'AI policy intelligence to monitor implementation A few countries have launched policy intelligence activities and issued annual reports to evaluate the implementation of their national AI strategies. Canada, Germany, Singapore, United Kingdom, United States, and the European Commission had published reports that monitored and evaluated the implementation of their AI strategies. Countries highlight milestones and accomplishments in these reports. These types of monitoring and evaluation publications can be expected to expand across countries as national AI strategies move into later stages of implementation. Several national or regional institutions have established AI observatories to oversee the implementation of national AI strategies and policies. For example, the German Labour Ministry launched the KI- Observatorium in March 2020 to help implement parts of Germany’s AI strategy and encourage the responsible, people-centred, and participatory use of AI in the world of work and society. Other observatories include: the Czech Republic’s AI Observatory and Forum (AIO&F); Quebec’s International Observatory on the Social Impacts of Artificial and Digital Intelligence in Canada; France’s Observatory on the Economic and Social Impact of AI; the Italian Observatory on AI; and Chile is considering an Observatory on AI and established a Labour Observatory to analyse the internal ecosystem, gather new evidence, and incorporate this evidence base into policy. Some countries report more detailed assessments, including information such as budgets, funding, and specific targets.

 'Ensuring these programmes are offered by governments only when the market does not offer similar services minimises the risk of public programmes making themselves indispensable and distorting the market. Governments face challenges with data access and management. The better the data used to train and optimise machine learning-based AI systems, the more impactful and inclusive the outcome. Despite evidence of economic and social benefits, challenges remain when creating a digital environment that enables access to data alongside strong data and privacy protections. Managing economic shifts and inequalities, facilitating transitions in the labour market and ensuring continuous education, training and skills development are also recognised across countries as key challenges. To evaluate the implementation of their national AI policies and strategies some countries have launched issued annual reports. By July 2020, Canada, the United Kingdom, the United States, Germany, and the European Union published reports that monitored and evaluated the implementation of their AI strategies and highlighted milestones and accomplishments. Singapore had published detailed information on the implementation of its AI strategy.

Other examples of such guidance include Guide to using AI for the Public Sector (2019); Data Ethics Framework (updated in 2020); Code of conduct for data-driven health and care technology (2018), and A Buyer’s Checklist for AI in Health and Care (2020); and ICO’s AI Auditing Framework (2020).'

 ""For example, Estonia established an Open Data Portal to give everyone access to internal datasets and open data. The Maltese government has proposed to hold various awareness campaigns for civil servants to help them understand the potential of AI, allowing frontline staff to discover potential use cases for AI in their work. In Turkey, an open data portal was established to share data produced by citizens, researchers, public institutions and organisations, and state affiliates. Stimulating the uptake of AI to provide better public services requires training: for example, Canada is developing foundational AI training which will be available to all federal public servants through the Canada School of Public Service’s Digital Academy. The Danish government also plans to establish an internal academy that provides AI training to its staff specialist and generalist training programmes. Many national AI strategies highlight ecosystems to use AI in the public sector (GovTech) and harness local data ecosystems and talents. For example: Colombia has prioritised the support to public entities in the adoption of GovtTech solutions. Estonia published in February 2020 #KrattAI, an interoperable network of AI applications, which will enable citizens to use public services with virtual assistants through voice-based interaction. #KrattAI is a network of both public and private sector AI solutions, which, from the user's point of view, act as a single channel for public services and information. Hungary’s AI strategy has a general goal of introducing data wallets and personalised data services to give citizens full control over their data, so they can decide who has access to their data, and what they are can do with the data, including the opportunity of directly profiting from such usage. The United Arab Emirates launched an AI Lab led by Smart Dubai in 2017.""

 'Governance structures for enabling all the above mandates vary across countries. Many countries have instituted dedicated public offices such as Ministry of AI (UAE), and Office of AI and AI Council (U.K.) while China and Japan have allowed existing ministries to take up AI implementation in their sectoral areas. Not just national governments, but even local city governments have become increasingly aware about the importance and potential of AI and have committed public investments. National governments have significantly increased public funding for AI through commitments such as increasing the R&D spend, setting up industrial and investment funds in AI startups, investing in network and infrastructure and AI-related public procurements. China, USA, France and Japan have committed significant public spending for AI technology development and adoption. Discussion Paper National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence forming “national teams” with large private players to undertake fundamental and applied research are some of the public-private partnership approaches various national governments have espoused. AI technology development and applications are evolving rapidly with major implications for economies and societies. A study by EY and NASCCOM found that by 2022, around 46% of the workforce will be engaged in entirely new jobs that do not exist today, or will be deployed in jobs that have radically changed skillsets5. If some countries decide to wait for a few years to establish an AI strategy and put in place the foundations for developing the AI ecosystem, it seems unlikely that they would be able to attain and match up to the current momentum in the rapidly changing socio-economic environment. Therefore, the need of the hour is to develop a policy framework that will help set up a vibrant AI ecosystem in India. A detailed study of various country strategies for AI is placed in the Appendix II: Global Country Strategy Review.'

A Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Plan. 11 TOWARDS AN AI STRATEGY IN MEXICO: Harnessing the AI Revolution Similarly, investment in research and development was widely acknowledged as key to ensuring a cutting- edge national AI industry. Different governments had different approaches to this, often dependent on how advanced their AI sectors are already. The USA, for example, notes that much of the long-term research required for AI is not necessarily attractive to the private sector,16 while France recommends guaranteeing capital to allow businesses to consistently take risks. 17 Given that advanced digital infrastructure and high- quality data is an essential precondition for widespread AI implementation, the majority of AI strategies were surprisingly muted on this subject. This may be because these preconditions are usually addressed in the precursors to national AI strategies, such as national digital strategies, and so were assumed to be already sufficiently in place in the majority of countries with AI strategies.'

Efforts are needed to improve environmental transparency and equity everywhereThere are concerns about an AI compute divide manifesting between private and public actors, and between advanced and emerging countries. This could run counter to efforts to promote environmental equity – generally understood as equal protection from environmental hazards and equal access to environmental benefits. Analysis of the top ten countries in AI research on the environment shows that the United States, EU27 and China lead in the number of publications (OECD AI Policy Observatory, 2022[131]). One aim of the Expert Group is to understand the AI compute divide between and within countries.

 'Many countries are engaged in international co-operation for AI which is taking place in fora including the Council of Europe, the European Union, the Group of Seven (G7), the Group of Twenty (G20), the Global Partnership on AI International Telecommunications Union (ITU), the OECD, the United Nations, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and the World Bank. Cross-border co-operation in AI research is also a priority. For example, the French National Research Agency, the German Research Foundation and the Japan Science and Technology Agency are calling for French-German-Japanese collaborative AI research projects. Similarly, the United Kingdom and the United States are seeking to strengthen their co-operation on AI research. In February 2020, the OECD launched OECD. AI, a platform for policy makers to monitor developments in the AI policy landscape and the OECD. AI Network of Experts (ONE AI), a multi-stakeholder expert group that is developing practical guidance to help implement the OECD AI Principles. The OECD also hosts the Secretariat of the Global Partnership on AI (GPAI), an initiative launched in June 2020 to conduct research and pilot projects on responsible AI. 1. AI policy design This section elaborates preliminary findings on i) AI policies that are at different stages of development; ii) the role of public consultations to promote inclusive social dialogue on AI; iii) governance approaches pursued by countries to co-ordinate the implementation of their AI policies; and iv) insights on emerging national AI regulatory and non-regulatory approaches. Countries are at different stages of implementation of their national AI strategies. Canada, Finland, Japan, and the United Kingdom were among the first to develop national AI strategies, setting targets and allocating budgets around 2017. Denmark, France, Germany, Korea, Russia and the United States followed suit in 2018 and 2019.'

Increasing investment Priority areas – Healthcare – Energy and utilities – Agriculture – Transport The Government of Denmark identifies four priority areas of the economy where public investment would be made to accelerate AI research and solution development and advance their adoption in the country. – Key dimension 5: Engaging in international collaboration Considering the pace, scope and global reach of AI technologies, it is an illusion to believe that any country could reap its full benefits by working in isolation. Open ecosystems are better suited for emerging technologies because they involve a set of expertise and capabilities, within academia and the industry, distributed across the world. Thus, it becomes imperative that nations develop a plan to draw on international collaboration. Nations should make efforts to collaborate and contribute, not just in technology development but also in global efforts towards regulation and governance.

The government will also consider the recently completed report of the Australian Human Rights Commission into Human Rights and Technology, which considered the human rights implications of new technology. To be a global leader in AI, it is also important that all Australians have the opportunity to be involved. The Australian Government recognises the need for this effort to be inclusive. For example, women made up just 19% of domestic ICT enrolments in 2019 (DESE 2020). A diverse and inclusive AI workforce will mean that Australia is better able to benefit from varied approaches to problem solving (UNESCO 2020). 19 Australia’s AI Action Plan Australia’s trade links with neighbouring countries are a major factor in our economic success, and there are rapidly increasing digital export opportunities in the region. International cooperation plays an important role in shaping technology standards, norms and ethics in line with our values. Building on partnerships and collaborations will help grow international trust in Australian AI products. These will also ensure our interests are supported through our involvement in international standard setting. This leadership will ensure that as we develop our AI capability, it will align with our values. It will also ensure all Australians share the opportunities and benefits. The case studies will share lessons learnt to help other businesses to apply the principles and to inspire more businesses to do this.'

 'AI will continue to bolster other digital technologies and elevate human knowledge and capability to new levels. New jobs can flow from this growth, with estimates that by 2034, there could be 1.2 million new technology jobs realised (Faethm 2020:11). Australia also has the right whole-of-economy settings in place. We have the right foundations for growing our digital economy. Australia has a competitive, market driven economy with free and open trade, strong digital infrastructure and a pipeline of skills that creates the right environment for firms to adopt AI as more products come on to market. This suite of policies provide support for business adoption of emerging technologies. These broader policies, whether specific or more structural, are supporting adoption of emerging technology like AI in Australia. The new measures announced in the 2021–22 Budget and outlined in this Action Plan build on these existing policies by providing targeted assistance to specifically support the adoption and development of AI in Australia, to drive a range of desired outcomes. The time for further action is now. We are not alone in recognising the enormous economic, scientific, social, and environmental benefits AI provides, with global investment in AI continuing to increase, and the pace of AI product development accelerating. To capture these benefits, the AI Action Plan will coordinate the efforts and focus of government, businesses, researchers and the community. Farmers use AI solutions to inform how to tend to their crops. Image credit: Getty The AI Action Plan is a key feature of the Australian Government’s Digital Economy Strategy. The Digital Economy Strategy aims to deliver on the Australian Government’s ambition for Australia to be a leading digital economy and society by 2030.

 'The strategy is led by the non-profit Canadian Institute for Advanced Research and backed with government funding of CAD 125 million (USD 100 million). Over five years, the funds will support programmes to expand Canada’s human capital, support AI research in Canada and translate AI research into public- and private-sector applications. The goals of the Pan-Canadian AI Strategy are: 1. Increase AI researchers and skilled graduates in Canada. 2. Establish interconnected nodes of scientific excellence in Canada’s three major AI institutes: in Edmonton (Alberta Machine Intelligence Institute), Montreal (Montreal Institute for Learning Algorithms) and Toronto (Vector Institute for Artificial Intelligence). 3. Develop a global programme on AI in Society and global thought leadership on the economic, social, ethical, policy and legal implications of advances in AI. 4. Support a national research community on AI. The federal government through the National Research Council Canada (NRC) plans research investments totalling CAD 50 million (USD 40 million) over a seven-year period to apply AI to key programme themes including: data analytics, AI for Design, cyber security, Canadian indigenous languages, support for federal superclusters and collaboration centres with Canadian universities, as well as strategic partnerships with international partners. In addition to this federal funding, the Quebec government is allocating CAD 100 million (USD 80 million) to the AI community in Montreal; Ontario is providing CAD 50 million (USD 40 million) to the Vector Institute for Artificial Intelligence.

Among these countries were a number that have adhered to the OECD principles and/or have created their own country-specific principles. While the responses focus on the ethical use of data, they can serve as a proxy measure for AI ethics. The use cases discussed in the previous chapter also show that public data and AI developments have encountered ethical challenges that could be mitigated or clarified if ethical guidance, standards and/or frameworks were in place to help actualise high-level principles. The following sections review the main instruments and initiatives that contribute to developing responsible, trustworthy and human-centric approaches to AI in the public sector. Figure 4.3.'

 'Three LAC countries – Argentina, Brazil and Mexico – have committed to these principles by virtue of their participation in the G20. Some countries have also designed their own country-specific principles. Adhering to or otherwise articulating clear principles for AI represents a positive step for international co-operation, and for bringing about an environment and culture aligned with the societal goals and values articulated in the Principles. Table 4.1 provides an overview of LAC government adherence to the OECD and G20 AI Principles and indicates where own country-specific principles have been put in place. The OECD Principles on Artificial Intelligence support AI that is innovative and trustworthy, and which respects human rights and democratic values. OECD member countries adopted the Principles on 22 May 2019 as part of the OECD Council Recommendation on Artificial Intelligence (OECD, 2019[5]). The Principles set standards for AI that are sufficiently practical and flexible to stand the test of time in a rapidly evolving field. They complement existing OECD standards in areas such as privacy, digital security risk management and responsible business conduct. The Recommendation identifies five complementary, values-based principles for the responsible stewardship of trustworthy AI: AI should benefit people and the planet by driving inclusive growth, sustainable development and well-being. AI systems should be designed in a way that respects the rule of law, human rights, democratic values and diversity, and they should include appropriate safeguards – for example, enabling human intervention where necessary – to ensure a fair and just society. There should be transparency and responsible disclosure around AI systems to ensure that people understand AI-based outcomes and can challenge them. AI systems must function in a robust, secure and safe way throughout their life cycles and potential risks should be continually assessed and managed.'

The report provides good practices and implementation of the five recommendations to policy makers contained in the OECD AI Principles. lessons Countries are at different stages of the development and implementation of national AI strategies and policies. Some countries, such as Canada and Finland, developed their national AI strategies as early as 2017, closely followed by Japan, France, Germany and the United Kingdom in 2018.

The recognized opaqueness of the latest generation of AI systems raises the issue of how to ensure that EU citizens are able to assert this right in contexts where a decision taken by an AI-powered system has a negative impact on their life. The scientific community took the measure of these concerns at an early stage, and started to provide technical solutions to increase both the robustness and the explainability of AI systems. Despite these efforts, there is still a gap between the resulting scientific outcomes of research and the legitimate expectations the society may have on this novel technology. Even if AI systems currently stay under human supervision in relatively controlled environment, AI is expected to be deployed on a much larger scale in the next years, and this situation calls for an appropriate answer from regulatory bodies.

 'In this situation, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), applicable since 2018, has introduced a set of rights that relate to the explainability of AI and, in particular, that provide any individual subject to such a decision the possibility to ask for an explanation. The recognized opaqueness of the latest generation of AI systems raises the issue of how to ensure that EU citizens are able to assert this right in contexts where a decision taken by an AI-powered system has a negative impact on their life. The scientific community took the measure of these concerns at an early stage, and started to provide technical solutions to increase both the robustness and the explainability of AI systems. Despite these efforts, there is still a gap between the resulting scientific outcomes of research and the legitimate expectations the society may have on this novel technology. Even if AI systems currently stay under human supervision in relatively controlled environment, AI is expected to be deployed on a much larger scale in the next years, and this situation calls for an appropriate answer from regulatory bodies.

Opportunity for Economic Growth According to the market estimates presented above, if the State of Israel manages to provide, for example, only 5% of the growth in the global AI market, this will translate to annual revenues of 30-40 billion USD. Even 1% of global growth will be of significant macroeconomic value. This is a rare economic opportunity for Israel. It is noteworthy that in the two areas in which Israel has dedicated sufficient effort to becoming a major player in the global market – weapons and cyber systems – Israeli exports amount to almost 10% of the global market.'

 'Artificial intelligence and intelligent systems are core technologies, and therefore Israel must establish itself as a leader in these fields in order to ensure its security, economy and the well-being of its citizens. With the right strategy, intelligent systems can be revolutionary at a national level, significantly raising the level of public services and products such as health, education, transportation and security, increase productivity, and enable the formation of highly useful products and solutions for markets in Israel and abroad. In general, it has the potential to significantly improve life in Israel. The purpose of the national initiative is to address the deficiencies required to complete the leap to technological and security resilience in the age of intelligent technologies, which in turn will be an engine of economic and social growth for the entire economy, as explained below. Objectives of the Initiative 1. Ensuring Technological Resilience Investment in Israeli leadership in the field of intelligent systems is critical to preserving the relevance of the Israeli high-tech industry and innovation and ensuring that it does not degenerate, in a manner that will fatally harm both the Israeli economy and the national security which relies on technological superiority. Reform is required in academia, the models used today are not adapted to the nature of research and practice in the field of intelligent systems. At the same time, it is necessary to increase the attractiveness and continuity of the Israeli technological ecosystem, fight the brain drain and encourage the return of Israeli researchers and experts to Israel. Ensuring Techno-Security Strength Israel’s technological superiority is a cornerstone of security theory and a condition for ensuring the existence of the state.'

 'For Israel to be able to leverage its existing basis and its relative advantages, it must also be able to face its challenges well, since although in some indices Israel’s absolute position in comparison with the rest of the world is satisfactory, it is not in itself enough to form a sustainable ecosystem in the field of artificial intelligence in Israel, which will also allow Israel to reap the required security, economic and political fruits. This requires a national strategy and additional investment to develop the necessary critical mass in physical infrastructure, human capital, data accessibility, and R&D in the field of intelligent technologies. In addition, enabling conditions must be ensured, such as cyber security and an adequate ethical and regulatory framework, as well as building strengths in all sectors and incentives for collaborations between them in order to establish the desired ecosystem. All of these will make it possible to reduce the gap between Israel and the leading global players and gain a relative advantage in the worlds of technology and high-tech in a way that will ensure our spot in the global race, which is critical to Israel’s economy, society, and national security. 20 | The National Initiative for Secured Intelligent Systems – Part I: Executive Summary and Recommendations In formulating the required strategy, we are, formally, somewhat behind most countries of the world. Official strategy papers for artificial intelligence (including the allocation of government budgets) have already been published not only by the major superpowers (such as the United States, Russia and China), or even “medium-sized” countries (such as the United Kingdom, France and others), but also by small countries (such as Finland, Singapore and others).'

It is headquartered at the Centre for AI & Data Governance of the Singapore Management University School of Law. The Centre focuses on industry-relevant research of AI as it relates to industry, society and business. In May 2018, the Swedish government published a report called Artificial Intelligence in Swedish Business and Society.

Although it has not yet enacted laws specific to AI ethics or risks, the Singaporean government passed revisions to the Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA) in 2012. This law governs how most businesses operating in Singapore treat personal information and prohibits data transfers to countries without comparable protections. Like the GDPR and other similar laws, the PDPA could affect AI development and adoption in Singapore—it could help businesses limit the privacy and data protection risks of automated systems but also pose implications for the data transfers and flows that are essential to their creation. In addition, Singapore has released nonbinding guidance to help organizations navigate data ethics and governance principles, such as transparency, fairness, and explainability. It developed the Trusted Data Sharing Framework94 in 2019 to help foster a nascent data sharing ecosystem by guiding companies and nongovernmental organizations through trust and security considerations of data exchanges. 95 The same year, Singapore also released its Model AI Governance Framework, which outlines how AI systems work, how to reduce bias in AI applications, and how to facilitate open and transparent communication. 96 Singapore’s Model AI Governance Framework is framed broadly to apply to a range of technologies, sectors, and business models, providing guidance in areas such as how to identify and address risks associated with AI adoption, such as accuracy and bias. Like the EU Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI, Singapore’s framework also offers suggestions on the levels of human oversight necessary to mitigate any potential risks from adoption.'

 'Infocomm Media Development Authority published the Digital Economy Framework for Action in May 2018. This maps out a framework for action to transform Singapore into a leading digital economy, identifying AI as a frontier technology to drive Singapore’s digital transformation (Singapore, 2018[36]). The Personal Data Protection Commission published a model AI governance framework in January 2019 to promote responsible adoption of AI in Singapore. The model framework provides practical guidance to convert ethical principles into implementable practices. It builds on a discussion paper and national discussions by a Regulators’ Roundtable, a community of practice comprising sector regulators and public agencies. Organisations can adopt the model framework voluntarily. It also serves as a basis to develop sector-specific AI governance frameworks. To develop Singapore into a leading knowledge centre with international expertise in AI policy and regulations, the country set up a five-year Research Programme on the Governance of AI and Data Use in September 2018. It is headquartered at the Centre for AI & Data Governance of the Singapore Management University School of Law. The Centre focuses on industry-relevant research of AI as it relates to industry, society and business. In May 2018, the Swedish government published a report called Artificial Intelligence in Swedish Business and Society. The report, which aims to strengthen AI research and innovation in Sweden, outlines six strategic priorities: i) industrial development, including manufacturing; ii) travel and transportation; iii) sustainable and smart cities; iv) healthcare; v) financial services; and vi) security, including police and customs.

 'In order to encourage adoption across the UK, the public sector should use targeted procurement to provide a boost to AI development and deployment In particular, given the impressive advances of AI in healthcare, and its potential, we considered the health sector as a case study. The NHS should look to capitalise on AI for the public good, and we outline steps to overcome the barriers and mitigate the risks around widespread use of this technology in medicine. Within the optimism about the potential of AI to benefit the UK, we received evidence of some distinct areas of uncertainty. There is no consensus regarding the adequacy of existing legislation should AI systems malfunction, underperform or otherwise make erroneous decisions which cause harm. We ask the Law Commission to provide clarity. We also urge AI researchers and developers to be alive to the potential ethical implications of their work and the risk of their work being used for malicious purposes. We recommend that the bodies providing grants and funding to AI researchers insist that applications for such funding demonstrate an awareness of the implications of their research and how it might be misused. We also recommend that the Cabinet Office’s final Cyber Security & Technology Strategy consider the risks and opportunities of using AI in cybersecurity applications, and conduct further research as how to protect datasets from any attempts at data sabotage. The UK must seek to actively shape AI’s development and utilisation, or risk passively acquiescing to its many likely consequences. There is already a welcome and lively debate between the Government, industry and the research community about how best to achieve this. But for the time being, there is still a lack of clarity as to how AI can best be used to benefit individuals and society. We propose five principles that could become the basis for a shared ethical AI framework.'

The CIFAR Pan-Canadian AI Strategy received an initial investment of C$125 million over five years from the Canadian government, the Royal Bank of Canada, and Facebook; the 2021 budget proposes to renew government funding for C$444 million over 10 years. 54 Building on these partnerships, the private sector has established over 45 AI R&D labs in Canada since 2017; Montreal, in particular, has received about C$900 million in foreign direct investment since 2017 and almost C$1 billion in public funding to support AI projects. 55 In 2018, the Université de Montréal, in collaboration with the Fonds de recherche du Québec, circulated the Montréal Declaration for a Responsible Development of AI after broad consultations with experts in government, industry, and civil society. 56 It provides ethical guidelines and recommendations to address various risks in designing and implementing artificial intelligence, including privacy protections, control over personal information, audits, and publicly accessible decisionmaking algorithms. In addition, Canada has issued regulations to address certain risks related to artificial intelligence and the processing of personal information in the federal government; the Directive on Automated Decision-Making came into effect April 19, 2019, requiring federal government bodies to complete algorithmic impact assessments prior to utilizing automated decisionmaking tools, notify affected parties both before and after automated decisions, and analyze all results for potential bias.'

 'In 2017, the Government of Canada announced EUR 84 million (CAD 125 million) for a Pan-Canadian Artificial Intelligence Strategy to retain and attract top academic talent, increase the number of post-graduate trainees and researchers in AI, promote collaboration between Canada’s main centres of AI expertise, and position Canada as a world-leading destination for companies seeking to invest in AI and innovation. The government selected CIFAR (Canadian Institute for Advanced Research), an independent, not-for-profit organisation that supports the advancement of science through international and interdisciplinary collaboration and high-risk, high-impact research, as the organisation responsible for its implementation. Other initiatives include the ‘Innovation Supercluster Initiative’ which is providing EUR 155 million (CAD 230 million) in funding to the Scale AI Supercluster to bring together retail, manufacturing, transportation, infrastructure and information and communications technology (ICT) sectors to build intelligent supply chains powered by AI. The State Council of China published its national AI strategy in July 2017 (Next-Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan). The strategy set the target of AI development in China, including becoming a global AI innovation centre by 2030 and building up an AI industry of USD 150 billion (RMB 1 trillion). Following the strategy, the Chinese government launched pilot AI projects called “National Pilot Areas for AI Innovative Development” to test the application of emerging technologies, explore effective policy tools and measure the social impact of technologies. The government is developing its 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-2025) that prioritises innovation and China’s long-term competitiveness in AI (Xia, 2021[10]).'

 'OECD/A Blueprint for Building National Compute Capacity for Artificial Intelligence/0/35'
 'While the present paper focuses on AI compute, ensuring access to sufficient data and safeguards for its responsible use are essential, as articulated in the OECD AI Principles, and is the subject of separate OECD work (OECD, 2019[3]; OECD, 2015[23]). What is the impact of sovereignty considerations and data localisation requirements on whether data is physically stored in-country (or in-region in the case of the European Union)? What challenges exist related to the compute needs of data for AI training and deployment? How much compute capacity is required to clean and prepare data for AI training or deployment? 5 AI compute in national policy initiatives. Countries and regions take varying approaches to providing the digital infrastructure and access required for the development and use of artificial intelligence (AI) (Figure 1). Different national goals for AI lead to different investment strategies. From building domestic infrastructure, to investments in the cloud, countries consider compute infrastructure investments on a case-by-case basis corresponding to national objectives. National AI initiatives related to computing resources often focus on general research and science infrastructure rather than AI specifically. While several countries have broader national HPC or cloud resources initiatives, few national AI plans have specifically targeted initiatives for assessing national AI compute capacity and needs. This section is informed the OECD AI Policy Observatory, which includes a database of over 800 AI policy initiatives from more than 69 countries and territories, and the European Union. The database collects qualitative and quantitative data on national trends in AI policy. It includes a taxonomy for classifying policy initiatives according to four themes: governance; financial support; AI enablers and other incentives; and guidance and regulation (OECD, 2022[21]).'

The United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority established the world\u2019s first regulatory sandbox in 2015. The sandbox seeks to provide financial firms with a) the ability to test products and services in a controlled environment; b) reduced time-to-market at potentially lower costs; c) support in identifying appropriate consumer protection safeguards to build into new products and services; and d) better access to finance (FCA, 2021[57]). This model has been replicated in more than 50 countries (BIS, 2020[58]). In 2020, the FCA partnered with The Alan Turing Institute to better understand the practical challenges of AI transparency and explainability in the financial sector. The European Commission is considering the development of large-scale AI testing and experimentation facilities, which will be available to all actors across Europe to help avoid duplication of efforts. These testing facilities may include regulatory sandboxes in selected areas (European Commission, 2020[59]).

 'This was a crucial stage because—as everyone knows—human resources are the first key to any project’s success. To kick-start the task force, we could rely on excellent sources, including the “France IA” report, spearheaded by Axelle Lemaire; the report by the Parliamentary Office Foreword for the Evaluation of Scientific and Technological Choices (OPECST), sponsored by my fellow MPs Claude de Ganay and Dominique Gillot; not to mention the CNIL’s outstanding works on the ethics of algorithms, along with the reports by the Employment Advisory Council (Conseil d’orientation pour l’emploi, COE). France Stratégie also provided input. The contributions grew in number, and soon there was a considerable amount of material to process! But working together, we were able to gather and summarise the masses of information provided by the hundreds of experts and thousands of members of the general public who contributed their ideas. I would like to extend my sincere thanks to Parlement & Citoyens, the non- partisan non-profit organisation that launched in record time the online platform to collect these contributions! We cannot conceive AI in a purely national framework, so this task force was also an opportunity for a series of brief, intense visits to the stimulating places driving AI internationally: Palo Alto, Beijing, Berlin, Regensburg, London, Zürich, Bologna, Lisbon, Tel Aviv and Haifa. I would like to thank the many efficient institutional bodies involved in organising the logistics behind these visits. It goes without saying that we also visited the most stimulating AI sites in France, including The Camp, near Aix- en-Provence, which deserves special mention for hosting our task force for a few days. This task force was a fascinating experience thanks to the wide variety of topics we studied.'

As well as contributing to implement the AI Principle of inclusive growth, sustainable development and well-being, this Plan also addresses transparency and explainability. Presented by the Minister of Economy and Finance Bruno Le Maire in July 2019, the Economic Action Plan of the French AI Strategy7 identifies three top priorities: building and structuring a strong French AI system; making AI accessible to all companies; and developing a data-driven French and European economy. To achieve this, the Plan uses the concept of “AI challenges” to give access to public funding to AI providers and users who propose solutions to concrete problems in four key sectors (health, transportation/mobility, environment, and defence/security).

 '4.2 SWOT Analysis To accurately determine the elements of an Egyptian AI strategy, it is important to conduct a status quo assessment of the state of AI in Egypt and the country’s readiness to embark on a journey of AI adoption. Egyptian scientists and engineers with expertise in AI are employed by universities, research centers, and industrial companies alike. Hundreds of AI researchers are employed by the National Research Center, the Academy of Scientific Research and Technology (ASRT) and its affiliates, Agriculture Research Center, etc. Many Egyptian students are choosing ICT-related subjects to study at the university level. As the governmental Faculties of Computers and Information are the areas associated with AI, the following (Table 1 and Figs. 5-13) show the statistics of the students, graduates, and academic staff in those faculties (2018/2019). These figures demonstrate the increasing interest of Egyptian youth to study ICT related subjects at the university level.'

Egypt gives its full support to the Strategy to ensure a successful implementation. I trust in the Egyptian competence, capable of mobilizing all energies to transform the Strategy into action plans, which can be translated into tangible, real-life results. We endeavor to keep up with AI developments to reach a new cultural milestone and create a promising future for our great country. In November 2019, the Egyptian Cabinet approved the formation of the National Council for Artificial Intelligence (NCAI) to include representatives from all relevant government entities as well as independent experts in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI). The Council’s main objective is to formalize and govern the implementation of Egypt’s National AI Strategy. The present document is the culmination of efforts by the Technical Committee of the National Council, and builds on previous work carried out in 2019 by the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology and the Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research, along with input from independent experts and private sector companies. The Technical Committee would like to extend its thanks to all parties for the roles they have played in producing this document. Recent studies and economic indicators all point to the net positive effect that can be realized from absorbing AI into international economies.

The country has 500 million euros earmarked in the federal budget to carry out the strategy for 2019, and 3 billion euros in total funds are planned to be provided by 2025. It is important to note that the strategy merely formulates intentions – whether these intentions will be put into policy is a completely different matter. The two documents reveal similarities in analysis and proposed solutions, such as on the need for talent development and the emphasis on facilitating a faster technology spillover from research to industries. Although France and Germany have different economic structures and industrial priorities, six areas feature prominently in both documents: 1. Research Both countries intend to spend more public money on AI research. The German government intends to finance at least 100 new professorships working on various aspects of AI research.'

 'At the same time, the strategy foresees building international links in research and investment, and encouraging private investments. For example, the Finnish Immigration Service uses the national customer service robot network called Aurora to provide multilingual communication (Finland, 2017[17]). In February 2018, the government also created a funding entity for AI research and commercial projects. The entity will allocate EUR 200 million (USD 235 million) in grants and incentives to the private sector, including SMEs. Finland reports some 250 companies working on AI development. This includes professionals and patients in the Finnish healthcare industry organisations and healthcare system, and the associated in-depth reforms (Sivonen, 2017[18]). The role of the Finnish state-funded Technical Research Centre of Finland and the Finnish Funding Agency for Technology and Innovation will also be expanded. French President Emmanuel Macron announced France’s AI strategy on 29 March 2018. It allocates EUR 1.5 billion of public funding into AI by 2022 to help France become an AI research and innovation leader. The measures are largely based on recommendations in the report developed by a member of parliament, Cédric Villani (Villani, 2018[19]). The strategy calls for investing in public research and education, building world-class research hubs linked to industry through public-private partnerships, and attracting foreign and French elite AI researchers working abroad. To develop the AI ecosystem in France, the strategy’s approach is to “upgrade” existing industries. Starting from applications in health, environment, transport and defence, it aims to help use AI to renew existing industries. It proposes to prioritise access to data by creating “data commons” between private and public actors; adapting copyright law to facilitate data mining; and opening public sector data such as health to industry partners.'
